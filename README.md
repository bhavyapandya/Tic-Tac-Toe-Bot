# TicTacToe-bot-using-js

TicTacToe Bot Using JS is a project that involves creating a TicTacToe game where the player can play against a bot that uses the alpha beta pruning algorithm to make its moves. The goal of the project is to create an intelligent bot that can play TicTacToe optimally.

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface for the game and the bot. The alpha beta pruning algorithm is implemented in JavaScript to create an efficient bot that can play TicTacToe at a high level. The game interface is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, allowing the player to focus on playing the game.

The project provides an opportunity to learn about artificial intelligence and game theory. It helps to understand the working of the alpha beta pruning algorithm and how it can be used to create an intelligent bot that can play TicTacToe optimally.

Overall, this project is a great way to learn about artificial intelligence, game theory, and JavaScript programming. It provides a fun and engaging way to learn and practice programming skills.
